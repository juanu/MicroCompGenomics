Created on January 27th, 2015.

This is a collection of scripts used for the comparative analysis of microbial genomes. Starting from different
annotation sources (IMG, NCBI, RAST), the idea is to prepare the data to search for orthologous groups,
perform analysis such as alignments, trees, and others.

Main requirements at this moment:
- Biopython
- Scipy
